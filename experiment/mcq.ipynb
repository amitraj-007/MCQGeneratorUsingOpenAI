      "What is LangChain?\n",
      "LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. It provides tools, abstractions, and integrations that make it easier to create applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, summarization tools, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain's core philosophy is modularity and chainability, meaning it helps developers break down complex workflows into smaller, manageable, and reusable components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Components of LangChain\n",
      "LLMs (Large Language Models):\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain supports multiple LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere).\n",
      "It provides wrappers to interact with these models and configure parameters like temperature, model_name, and max_tokens.\n",
      "Prompts:\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain offers tools to manage, format, and template prompts effectively.\n",

      "Types of Chains:\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple Chains: Sequentially process inputs and outputs.\n",

Its stated mission is to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\".[5] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,[6] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora.[7][8] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\n",

      "The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.,[9] registered in Delaware, and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC.[10] Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity, having invested US$13 billion.[11] It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.[12]\n",

      "In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.[13][14]\n",

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research.[15][16] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.[10] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all.[17] The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[18][19] OpenAI was initially run from Brockman's living room.[20] It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.[21][22]\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\".[23] Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.[23] In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.[23]\n",

Its stated mission is to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\".[5] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,[6] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora.[7][8] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.,[9] registered in Delaware, and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC.[10] Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity, having invested US$13 billion.[11] It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.[12]\n",

      "In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.[13][14]\n",

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research.[15][16] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.[10] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all.[17] The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[18][19] OpenAI was initially run from Brockman's living room.[20] It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.[21][22]\n",
